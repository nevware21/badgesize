# badgesize

This will be the location of the public portions of the new home for `img.badgesize.io`.

We are currently reconstructing the site as we will not be using the same code as previously publish, but it is intended to support the same syntax as defined by the [original owner/site](https://github.com/ngryman/badge-size)

We dont yet have an official timeframe for when this service will restart and the level of support that will be provided as we only recently obtained control of the domain.

Please feel free to create issues / requests via GitHub on this repo.
